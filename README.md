## Software
- [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html#install-hub-linux)
- [Unity version 2022.3.29f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive)
- [ROS2 Humble for Ubuntu](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)
## Unity Section<br />
### Unity Hub<br />
Install the Unity Hub from [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html#install-hub-linux). <br />

or use the same steps below:<br />
To install the _**Unity Hub**_ on a Debian or Ubuntu Linux distribution, you need to add the Unity Hub Debian repository along with the public signing key to verify the integrity of the packages.
1. To add the public signing key, run the following command:
```
wget -qO - https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/keys/public | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg > /dev/null
```
2. To add the Unity Hub repository, you need an entry in /etc/apt/sources.list.d. Run the following command to add the Unity Hub repository:
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg] https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/repos/deb stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unityhub.list'
```
3. Update the package cache and install the package:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install unityhub
```
Note: For some systems, you may need to ensure the following: <br />
 - The directory /usr/share/keyrings exists. <br />
 - The user or group installing the Hub has write permissions to the /usr/share/keyrings directory. <br />
 - The user or group installing Hub has at least read permissions to the resulting file Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg. <br />
 
To remove the Unity Hub from the system, run the following command:
``
sudo apt-get remove unityhub
``
### Unity version 2022.3.29f1
Go to [Unity Download Archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) to install the specified version into the Unity Hub.
### Unity Create Project
Create a project in Unity. Name given in this example is "Unity_ROS2_msgs". Selected Unity version is 2022.3.29f1.<br />

### Adding Visual Studio Code to Unity

### Creating Environment and ROS2 Messages
Similar, ROS2 message generation can also be found in [ROS–Unity Integration: Publisher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/main/tutorials/ros_unity_integration/publisher.md) and [ROS–Unity Integration: Subscriber](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/main/tutorials/ros_unity_integration/subscriber.md)

In the Hierarchy the project scenes can be found. Scene or environments are the things that will contain different game_objects which will construct the game. The current open scene SampleScene Contrains Main Camera & Directional Light. Click the "+" icon beside Hierarchy or Right Click under the scene will give option to create game_objects.<br />

**Environment:**
 - A Cube Object was created.<br />
 - A Plane was created.<br />
 - A Material Was created and its color was set as Blue.<br />
 - The Planes color was set as the newly created color material by dragging the material upon the plane.<br />
 - Double Clicking the cube will center the cube in the scene. <br />

**ROS-TCP-Connector Package Install:** <br />

Install ROS-TCP-Connector Package from [ROS-TCP-Connector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector/tree/main).

Or use the same steps below. This [ROS-TCP-Connector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector/tree/main) repository contains two Unity packages: the ROS TCP Connector, for sending/receiving messages from ROS, and the Visualizations Package, for adding visualizations of incoming and outgoing messages in the Unity scene.

1. Using Unity 2020.2 or later, open the Package Manager from `Window` -> `Package Manager`.
2. In the Package Manager window, find and click the + button in the upper lefthand corner of the window. Select `Add package from git URL....`
   
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29758400/110989310-8ea36180-8326-11eb-8318-f67ee200a23d.png)
   
4. Enter the git URL for the desired package. to declare a specific package version, or exclude the tag to get the latest from the package's `main` branch.
    1. For the ROS-TCP-Connector, enter
       ```
       https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector.git?path=/com.unity.robotics.ros-tcp-connector
       ```
    2. For Visualizations, enter
       ```
       https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector.git?path=/com.unity.robotics.visualizations
       ```
5. Click `Add`.

To install from a local clone of the [ROS-TCP-Connector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector/tree/main) repository, see [installing a local package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html) in the Unity manual.

### *Note: you can append a version tag to the end of the git url, like `#v0.4.0` or `#v0.5.0`

**ROS2 Message:** <br />
 - After installation of ROS-TCP-Connector Package in unity go to `Robotics`-> `ROS setting`.<br />
 - And change the protocol to ROS2 as given in image.<br />
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c72c3e62-a426-402b-9fe6-0d2039c71dc5)

 - A C# Script `UnityMessageToTCP.cs` was create and the following code was written in it.
```
(null null)
```
 - Create new empty gameobject and name it `RosPublisher`.
 - Add the created script to the new gameobject **RosPublisher** in the scene by inspection-> add component -> UnityMessageToTCP.cs or dragging it to the empty area below add component in inspection.<br />
(image null null)
 - In that Component add the Cube gameobject by clicking the empty place and selecting the cube or dragging the cube to that empty place.<br />
(image null null)

Unity game can not be played until ROS-message is generated. To do that a ROS2 message package will be created.

## ROS2 Section (mabye add this 1st)
### Installing of ROS2 Humble
Installation process and files can be found at [Ubuntu (deb packages) ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)

Or follow the same steps below:<br />

Set locale:<br />
Make sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8. If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale may be something minimal like POSIX. We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if you’re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.<br />
```
locale  # check for UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # verify settings
```
Setup Sources:<br />
You will need to add the ROS 2 apt repository to your system.<br />
First ensure that the Ubuntu Universe repository is enabled.<br />
```
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```
Now add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt.
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
```
Then add the repository to your sources list.
```
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```
Install ROS 2 packages:
Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.
```
sudo apt update
```
ROS 2 packages are built on frequently updated Ubuntu systems. It is always recommended that you ensure your system is up to date before installing new packages.
```
sudo apt upgrade
```
`
Warning ::::
Due to early updates in Ubuntu 22.04 it is important that systemd and udev-related packages are updated before installing ROS 2. The installation of ROS 2’s dependencies on a freshly installed system without upgrading can trigger the removal of critical system packages.
Please refer to ros2/ros2#1272 and Launchpad #1974196 for more information.
