## Part 4. Install Unity Hub<br />
Install the Unity Hub from [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html#install-hub-linux). <br />

or use the same steps below:<br />
To install the _**Unity Hub**_ on a Debian or Ubuntu Linux distribution, you need to add the Unity Hub Debian repository along with the public signing key to verify the integrity of the packages.
1. To add the public signing key, run the following command:
```
wget -qO - https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/keys/public | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg > /dev/null
```
2. To add the Unity Hub repository, you need an entry in /etc/apt/sources.list.d. Run the following command to add the Unity Hub repository:
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg] https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/repos/deb stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unityhub.list'
```
3. Update the package cache and install the package:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install unityhub
```
Note: For some systems, you may need to ensure the following: <br />
 - The directory /usr/share/keyrings exists. <br />
 - The user or group installing the Hub has write permissions to the /usr/share/keyrings directory. <br />
 - The user or group installing Hub has at least read permissions to the resulting file Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg. <br />
 
To remove the Unity Hub from the system, run the following command:
``
sudo apt-get remove unityhub
``
